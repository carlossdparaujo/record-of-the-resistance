# Record of the Resistance

## About us
Recordkeepers aims to be a space for building bridges and resources among Latin America counter- archivists, memory keepers and their communities. These archives promote individual and collective sense of belonging to populations that have had their memory damned by centuries of colonialism politics. This form of strategic memory neglect focuses on individuals that are dissents due to sexual orientation, race, gender identity, ethnicity and political alignment.

## Goal
Mapping counter archives in the Latin America and the Caribbean region with the input from dissident communities, a place where researchers, activists can use to search for and share the existence ofÂ the dissident archives.
